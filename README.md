- Contributing:
    
    The main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving Batta, making it more efficient and easier to use.
    Development of Batta happens in the open on GitHub, and I'll be grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements.
    Read below to learn how you can take part in improving Batta.
    
    - Open Development: 
        All work on Batta happens directly on GitHub. External contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.
    
    - Branch Organization: 
        Submit all changes directly to the main branch. I am not going to be using separate branches for development. Moreover, I am going
        to do my best to keep main in good shape, with all tests passing.
    
    - Bugs:
        I'll be using GitHub Issues for the public bugs. I'll be keeping a close eye on this and trying to make it clear when I have an internal fix in 
        progress. 
        Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist. 
        The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case.
        
    - Proposing A Change:
        If you intend to make any non-trivial changes to the implementation, we recommend filing an issue. This lets me reach a decision on your
        proposal before you put significant effort into it. 
        If you’re only fixing a bug, it’s fine to submit a pull request right away but I still recommend to file an issue detailing what you’re fixing. 
        This is helpful in case I don’t accept that specific fix but want to keep track of the issue.
        
    - Sending Your First Pull Request:
        I'll be monitoring for pull requests. I will review your pull request and either merge it, request changes to it, 
        or close it with an explanation.
        
        Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:
        
        1. Fork the repository and create your branch from main.
        2. Run npm install in the repository root.
        3. If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
